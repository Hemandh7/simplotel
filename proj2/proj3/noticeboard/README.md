Edit the text in the textarea.
Click the "Save" button to save the changes.

Click the "Delete" button on a note to remove it from the board.
4. Pin/Unpin Note
Click the "Pin" button on a note to make it non-draggable and prevent overlapping.
Click the "Unpin" button to make the note draggable again.
5. Drag and Drop Notes
